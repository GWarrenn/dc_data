# dc_data

Collection of various DC datasets gathered from http://opendata.dc.gov/ to address and answer questions about the District that I find interesting.

Published analyses include:

* [Bike Accidents in the District](https://gwarrenn.github.io/Bike-Accidents-in-The-District/)
* [Investigating Racial Inequity in D.C. Stop & Frisk](https://gwarrenn.github.io/Stop-and-Frisk-DC/)
